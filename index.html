<p> messages just got out   

love.

someone telling you what they are doing is simply a means to open a conversation with you. 

Send them a picture,

“I hope your day goes well!” 

People use this phrase to share some messages of encouragement to keep your spirits high during these challenging times. </p>

  
<h1> I hope your day goes well! </h1>  
  

<p>....Mysterious "happy day" texts? 

Scams! 

You have no obligation to respond, and there is no good reason to respond.
  
  You would be responding to a scammer, and there is no upside to that. 

When you run out of the mental energy to reply to messages ... 

new scam or something?  

I get weird texts ... 

Just got this one via text... 

Surrendering Isn't the Same as Giving Up. </p>
