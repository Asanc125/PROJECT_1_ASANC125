love.
<br>
someone telling you what they are doing is simply a means to open a conversation with you. 
<br>
Send them a picture,
<br>
“I hope your day goes well!” 
<br>
People use this phrase to share some messages of encouragement to keep your spirits high during these challenging times. </p>

<p>....Mysterious "happy day" texts? 
<br>
Scams! 
<br>
You have no obligation to respond, and there is no good reason to respond.
  <br>
  You would be responding to a scammer, and there is no upside to that. 
<br>
When you run out of the mental energy to reply to messages ... 
<br>
new scam or something?  
<br>
I get weird texts ... 
<br>
Just got this one via text... 
<br>
Surrendering Isn't the Same as Giving Up. </p>
